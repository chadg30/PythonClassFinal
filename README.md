# Python Final Project
## Chad Green, Elijah McClymonds, Mike Elias
### Part 1: Quiz
Part one was split up into multiple functions that were divided between the group members.
Mike: take_quiz and clear_console.
Chad: validate_data and conversion.
Elijah: generate_questions.
Mike and Chad collaborated on the record data function.                
Overall, the program uses a csv file and user-input to output a quiz and input user data.
The user enters a valid name and student ID, then asks the user how many questions 
they want to answer. The program then initiates the quiz and allows the user to
answer each question 1 after the other. The data being the users ID, firstname, lastname, 
the score that they got, the time it took them to complete the quiz, and lastly all
of the questions and the students answers are outputted to a separate text file for that specific student.
### Part 2:
Part two consisted of changing two games. All of the group members got together and collaborated 
on the changes applied to the games.
#### Connect 4:
Connected 4 was changed in 2 ways. First, we changed the game so that it is two player
instead of a user against a computer. Two users get to control the pieces and play against
each other. In addition, the game was edited to produce an arrow image to indicate each
users turn, and the winner images were changed to indicate whether black or red won.
#### Snake:
Snake was changed in three ways. The code was edited so that the speed of the worm
would get faster as the user collects apples. In addition, the code was also edited 
to include a high score. The high score is saved to a file and then applied to each separate
game play. The high score is also displayed on the screen. The final change was adding
a border to the top of the game. This keeps the high score and the game score out of 
the grid in which the game is played.
